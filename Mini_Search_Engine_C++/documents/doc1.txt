Search engines are software systems designed to retrieve information from large collections of documents.
A typical search engine works by crawling indexing and ranking documents.

Modern search engines rely heavily on inverted index data structures.
An inverted index maps each word to the documents in which it appears.
This allows fast search without scanning all documents repeatedly.

Efficient search engines store term frequency positions and byte offsets.
These details help in ranking results performing phrase search and generating relevant snippets.

Information retrieval systems use advanced ranking algorithms such as TF-IDF and BM25.
These algorithms measure how important a word is within a document compared to the entire corpus.

Search engines also perform query processing including tokenization normalization and stemming.
Query optimization techniques help improve performance and reduce response time.

Snippet generation is an important feature of search systems.
It provides users with contextual previews of matched query terms within documents.
