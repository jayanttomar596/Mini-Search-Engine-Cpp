Information retrieval is a field of computer science that deals with searching
and retrieving information from large collections of data.

Inverted indexing is the backbone of most search engines.
Instead of scanning every document the system directly looks up the word
in the inverted index and retrieves the relevant documents.

Trie based indexing supports prefix matching and fast autocomplete.
Autocomplete features are commonly seen in search bars and IDEs.

Search algorithms must be optimized for speed and memory efficiency.
Storing positions offsets and frequencies enables advanced search features
such as phrase queries proximity search and result ranking.
