Efficient data structures are essential for building scalable search engines.
Inverted indexes are commonly used to map terms to document identifiers.

Trie data structures are used in search engines for implementing autocomplete functionality.
When a user types a prefix the trie helps suggest possible search terms.

Hash tables and trees are also widely used in information retrieval systems.
These data structures improve lookup performance and reduce latency.

Position based indexing supports phrase queries and proximity search.
This allows search engines to find documents where words appear together within a given distance.

Document frequency and term frequency are important statistics for ranking algorithms.
TF-IDF uses these values to determine relevance scores.

Efficient indexing techniques reduce memory usage and speed up query evaluation.
Understanding data structures is crucial for implementing modern search systems.
