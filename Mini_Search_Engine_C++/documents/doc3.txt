Ranking algorithms are used to order documents based on their relevance to a query.
TF-IDF is a classic ranking method used in many search engines.

Term frequency measures how often a word appears in a document.
Inverse document frequency measures how rare the word is across all documents.

BM25 is an improved ranking algorithm that considers document length normalization.
It provides better relevance estimation than TF-IDF in most cases.

Ranking systems must balance term importance and document length.
Long documents may contain more words but that does not always mean they are more relevant.

Phrase search and proximity search improve search accuracy.
They allow the system to detect whether query terms appear close to each other.

Relevance ranking is a critical component of information retrieval systems.
Better ranking improves user satisfaction and search performance.
