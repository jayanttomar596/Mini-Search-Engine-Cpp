Building a mini search engine is a great way to understand core concepts
of data structures and algorithms.

A search engine typically has two phases indexing and querying.
During indexing documents are processed and stored in data structures
such as inverted indexes and tries.

During querying the engine retrieves results in near constant time.
This is achieved by avoiding full document scans.

Autocomplete search suggestions improve usability and efficiency.
Trie structures are ideal for implementing such features.
Understanding these concepts is essential for backend and system design roles.


Search is a fundamental operation in information retrieval.
