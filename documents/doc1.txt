Search engines are software systems designed to carry out web search.
A search engine searches documents for specified keywords and returns a list
of documents where the keywords were found.

Modern search engines rely heavily on inverted index data structures.
An inverted index maps words to the documents in which they appear.
This allows fast search without scanning all documents repeatedly.

The trie data structure is commonly used in search engines for autocomplete.
When a user types a prefix, the trie helps suggest possible search terms.
This improves user experience and reduces typing effort.

Efficient search systems store word frequency positions and byte offsets.
These details help in ranking results phrase search and snippet generation.
Search performance is a critical factor in information retrieval systems.
